- **Unions**: Return different types from a field
- **Directives**: Add metadata to schema
- **Custom Scalars**: Define custom data types

## Performance

Use DataLoader to batch and cache database queries.

## Versioning

GraphQL schemas evolve without breaking changes.

## Conclusion

Good schema design makes GraphQL APIs powerful and maintainable.`,

    content: `# Edge Computing and CDN Strategies

Edge computing brings computation closer to users for better performance.

## What is Edge Computing?

Processing data near the source rather than in centralized data centers.

## Benefits

### Reduced Latency
Faster response times for users.

### Bandwidth Optimization
Process data locally, send only results.

### Resilience
Distributed architecture improves reliability.

## CDN Strategies

- **Static Asset Caching**: Serve files from edge locations
- **Dynamic Content**: Edge functions for personalization
- **API Acceleration**: Cache API responses
- **Security**: DDoS protection at the edge

## Popular Platforms

Cloudflare Workers, AWS CloudFront, Fastly, Vercel Edge.

## Conclusion

Edge computing is essential for global, high-performance applications.`,

    content: `# Accessibility in Web Development

Accessibility ensures everyone can use your application, regardless of abilities.

## WCAG Guidelines

### Perceivable
Information must be presentable to users.

### Operable
Interface components must be operable.

### Understandable
Information must be understandable.

### Robust
Content must work with assistive technologies.

## Implementation

- **Semantic HTML**: Use proper HTML elements
- **ARIA Labels**: Provide context for screen readers
- **Keyboard Navigation**: Ensure full keyboard access
- **Color Contrast**: Meet minimum contrast ratios
- **Alt Text**: Describe images for screen readers

## Testing

Use tools like axe, WAVE, and screen readers for testing.

## Conclusion

Accessibility is not optional—it's a fundamental requirement.`,

    content: `# The Evolution of JavaScript ES2025

JavaScript continues to evolve with powerful new features.

## Recent Additions

### Pattern Matching
Elegant conditional logic handling.

### Records and Tuples
Immutable data structures.

### Temporal API
Modern date and time handling.

## Async Improvements

- **Top-level await**: Use await at module top level
- **Promise.any()**: Race promises, return first success
- **Async iteration**: Process async data streams

## Developer Experience

Optional chaining, nullish coalescing, and private class fields.

## Future Features

Decorators, pipeline operator, and more are coming.

## Conclusion

JavaScript is becoming more powerful while remaining accessible.`,

Real-time features are essential for modern interactive applications.

## Communication Protocols

### WebSockets
Full-duplex communication channel.

### Server-Sent Events (SSE)
Server pushes updates to clients.

### Long Polling
Fallback for older browsers.

## Technologies

- **Socket.io**: WebSocket library with fallbacks
- **Pusher**: Hosted real-time service
- **Firebase**: Real-time database
- **GraphQL Subscriptions**: Real-time GraphQL

## Use Cases

Chat applications, live notifications, collaborative editing, gaming.

## Scaling Considerations

Use message queues and Redis for horizontal scaling.

## Conclusion

Real-time features enhance user experience and engagement.`,

Low-code platforms enable faster application development with less coding.

## What Are They?

Visual development environments that generate code from drag-and-drop interfaces.

## Popular Platforms

- **OutSystems**: Enterprise low-code platform
- **Mendix**: Collaborative development platform
- **Bubble**: No-code web app builder
- **Webflow**: Visual web development

## Benefits

- **Speed**: Build applications faster
- **Accessibility**: Non-developers can create apps
- **Consistency**: Standardized patterns and components

## Limitations

Limited customization, vendor lock-in, performance concerns.

## Conclusion

Low-code complements traditional development, not replaces it.`,

Choosing the right architecture pattern is crucial for application success.

## Layered Architecture

Traditional N-tier architecture with presentation, business, and data layers.

## Microservices

Distributed architecture with independent services.

## Event-Driven Architecture

Components communicate through events.

## Hexagonal Architecture

Domain-centric design with ports and adapters.

## CQRS and Event Sourcing

Separate read and write models, store events instead of state.

## Choosing a Pattern

Consider scalability needs, team size, and domain complexity.

## Conclusion

Different patterns solve different problems—choose wisely based on requirements.`,
